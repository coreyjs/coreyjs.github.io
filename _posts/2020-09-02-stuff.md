Recently I have been working on a space station builder/rts type game in UE4.  The core idea is the freedom to build and expand your space station while also keeping your defenses up to face the ever increasing attacks by enemy ships.  You can think of this as a mixture of simple RTS mechanics with hints of tower defense.  I really hate being bogged down by super deep and complex strategy systems, so my goal is to create something fairly fun and simple to play while giving you the depth and freedom to build whatever you want. I have been making sure to post regulalry to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/corey_s_) with progression pics and gifs. 

From newer to early:
