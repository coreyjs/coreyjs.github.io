I am a software engineer and game developer living in Buffalo, NY.  Beautiful summers and cold winters, I would not have it any other way.


You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/corey_s_), on [Github](https://github.com/coreyjs), sometimes blogging on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/coreyjs), doing art stuff on [Artstation](https://coreyjs.artstation.com/) and last but not least the [insta grams](https://www.instagram.com/jastora_/).


I love game dev and have been working recently in Unreal Engine 4.  I published my first game, Deadstorm, way back in the early iOS app store days.  Since removed, but not after hitting 50k downloads.  Lately I have been working on some prototypes around third person story telling.


I have been a full time software engineer since early 2010.  I tend to jump around and explore as much technology as I can.  My background is in Ruby, Python, C#, Go, and C++.  I have mostly been a backend engineer, building API's and building out distributed systems.  


Wanna chat about games, game design, system design, web stuff, mentoring or career advice?  Feel free to email me at coreyjs@hey.com, or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/corey_s_).  I am wayyy to active on Twitter.
